## ✨ Features

*   **Interactive Fretboard**: Visualize notes dynamically.
*   **Mode Selection**:
    *   🎵 **Scale Mode**: Select a root note and a scale type (e.g., Major, Natural Minor, Pentatonic Minor) to see all corresponding notes highlighted on the fretboard.
    *   🎼 **Chord Mode**: Choose a root note and a chord type (e.g., Major, Minor, Dominant 7th) to display the chord's notes.
    *   👆 **Pick Mode**: Click directly on frets to select notes.
        *   Identifies potential chords formed by the selected notes.
        *   Suggests additional notes that could complete common chords.
        *   Shows all available notes when 0 or 1 note is selected for easy exploration.
